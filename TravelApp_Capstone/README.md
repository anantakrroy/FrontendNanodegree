# Travel App Project
Create a basic travel planner application which fetches the weather and an image of the location by allowing users to choose the location and trip dates 

## Overview
An asynchronous web app that uses Web API and user data to dynamically update the UI.

## Application design
* A form to enter the location with the dates of travel (Start date - End date). 
* If the trip is within a week, current weather forecast is displayed. 
* If the trip is beyond a week, a predicted forecast is shown.

The application is made possible by using APIs - [Pixabay](https://pixabay.com/) , [DarkSky API](https://darksky.net/dev/docs) and Geonames.
