                    <p>Tigers are the largest members of the cat family and are renowned for their <strong>power and
                            strength.</strong></p>
                    <p>Tigers live alone and aggressively scent-mark large territories to keep their rivals away. They
                        are <em>powerful nocturnal hunters</em> that travel many miles to find buffalo, deer, wild pigs,
                        and
                        other large mammals. Tigers use their <em>distinctive coats</em> as camouflage (no two have
                        exactly the
                        same stripes). They lie in wait and creep close enough to attack their victims with a quick
                        spring and a fatal pounce. A hungry tiger can eat as much as 60 pounds in one night, though they
                        usually eat less.</p>
                    <p>Despite their fearsome reputation, most tigers avoid humans; however, a few do become dangerous
                        maneaters. These animals are often sick and unable to hunt normally, or live in an area where
                        their traditional prey has vanished.</p>
                    <p>Females give birth to litters of two to six cubs, which they raise with little or no help from
                        the male. Cubs cannot hunt until they are 18 months old and remain with their mothers for two to
                        three years, when they disperse to find their own territory.</p>
