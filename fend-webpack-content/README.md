# Webbpack Express Example App

The goal of this repo is be an example of a basic but functional app built on Express and Webpack.

If you want to follow along, start from master and look at the numbered branches of this project. Each one is a step along the path to creating a fully functional webpack setup. In each branch, there will be a documentation file that lists out the steps taken in that branch (each step is also a git commit if you look at the history) which you can use as a checklist when setting up your own projects. 

## Get Up and Running

Fork this repo, then clone your forked repo down to your computer:

```
git clone -- git@github.com:[your-user-name]/webpack-express.git --
```

`cd` into your new folder and run:
- ```npm install```
- ```npm start``` to start the app
- this app runs on localhost:8080, but you can of course edit that in server.js
